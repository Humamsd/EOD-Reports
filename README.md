# EOD-Report 
## Today's Progress
- I had a meeting session with Mr. Hackney in which we discussed the standing of the Phoenix team. He advised me regarding the team management and the overall role to be played as a team lead. Furthermore, we discussed SILK CORP and similar future ideas. We exchanged ideas regarding the future projects and the overall model of such projects in Pakistan. Lastly, he assigned me some important tasks that are to be done with sheer devotion and dedication.
- I had a training session regarding GitHub where I learnt about creating a repository,creating a milestone, commiting changes,  creating an issue, assigning the assignees to the issue, and adding labels etc. The session was a success where I have learnt the basics of GitHub which will enhance my onboarding literacy in many ways.
## Agenda for the team
- To teach them basic conversational and chat manners.
- To make sure their trainings are in process.
- To make sure that they are consistant and committed to the project.
